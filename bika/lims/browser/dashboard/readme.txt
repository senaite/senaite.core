"All" and "Mine" selection functionality:
=========================================

A selection list with the values 'All' and 'Mine' will be added above each
section of the Dashboard. The panels and information within each panel will
change according to the option selected: for example, if the user selects
'Mine', the panel with the summary of worksheets and worksheets statuses will
only take into account the worksheets to which the user is assigned.

Panels visibility
=================

The labmanager will be able to configure the visibility of each panel on a
user-role basis directly from the dashboard (configuration option
embedded in each panel).
