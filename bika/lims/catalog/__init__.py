# --Some important information:--
#
# - CatalogTool module. Here we can find the default indexes that plone
#  expects from its acatlogs. Be aware that if any of those indexes and
#  columns are missing, some specific queries or actions over the acatalog
#  might fail:
# https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/blob/4.3.x/Products/CMFPlone/CatalogTool.py
#
# - Here we have the portal_catalog definition, we can take some tips from its
# index definitions:
# https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/blob/4.2.x/Products/CMFPlone/profiles/default/catalog.xml
