     - allow_any: change it to True if you want users to be able to select the
       skin to use from their personal preferences management page. In the
       ZMI, this value is known as 'Skin flexibility'.
     - cookie_persistence: change it to True if you want to make the skin cookie
       persist indefinitely. In the ZMI, this value is known as 'Skin Cookie
       persistence'.

 <!-- A skin-path in this file corresponds to a Skin Selection in the
     'Properties' tab of the portal_skins tool, in the ZMI.
     You can define for each new skin path the layers that it holds. A new
     skin can be based on another existing one by using the 'based-on'
     attribute.
     The definition of a layer accepts these parameters:
       - name: quite self explanatory, the name of the layer.
       - insert-before: name of the layer before which it must be added.
       - insert-after: name of the layer after which it must be added.
       Note: insert-before (and -after) accepts the value "*" which means
       "all".
