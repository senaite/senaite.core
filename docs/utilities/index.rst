Utilities
=========

Utilities are the mechanism that allows to extend the behavior of
not only senaite.core, but also Plone and Zope. SENAITE comes with plenty of
hooks for utilities that can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as
changing the default behavior for the generation of IDs, add columns and filters
in listings, new types of reports, trap events, etc.
