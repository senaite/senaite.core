Adapters
========

Adapters are the mechanism that allows to extend and change the behavior of
not only senaite.core, but also Plone and Zope. SENAITE comes with plenty of
hooks for adapters that can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as
changing the default behavior for the generation of IDs, add columns and filters
in listings, new types of reports, trap events, etc.

In this chapter, the most commonly used adapters for SENAITE are discussed.
