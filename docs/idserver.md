Exteral ID Server
-----------------

If you are installing a clustering setup with multiple ZEO servers, the
content IDs generated by Bika will need to be unique among all servers.

An ID server script is included to handle this task.  The ID server is
located in the scripts/ folder of your Bika product directory.

### In buildout.cfg, add the IDServerURL environment variable

    [instance]
    environment-vars =
        IDServerURL http://localhost:8081

### Run buildout

    $ cd Plone/zinstance
    $ bin/buildout

### Configure the ID server start script

Edit the start-id-server or start-id-server.BAT script, and ensure that the
PYTHON, BIKA_BASE, and PORT settings are correct for your installation.

### Start the ID Server:

Linux: $ ./start-id-server

Windows: Double-click on start-id-server.BAT.
