# Buildout Configuration File for Standalone Plone
# ------------------------------------------------
# $LastChangedDate: 2010-11-21 10:00:15 -0300 (Sun, 21 Nov 2010) $ $LastChangedRevision: 45894 $
#
# After making changes in this configuration file,
# you should run bin/buildout to update the components.
# 
# ALWAYS back up all Plone/Zope data and components
# before changing configuration.
# 
# Running "bin/buildout" will update your installation,
# installing missing components as necessary.
# 
# Use "bin/buildout -n" to update many components here to the newest
# available releases.
# This will update the add-on products you've added in the eggs= lines.
# This will not, however, upgrade Plone itself (or anything else you've
# pinned with a version specification). To upgrade Plone itself, see the
# comments in "Plone Component Versions".
#
# Tutorial instructions for using zc.buildout for
# configuration management are available at:

############################################
# Plone Component Versions
# ------------------------
# This version of the Unified Installer has the components of Plone 4 
# preloaded so that it can install without an Internet connection.
# If you want to update, uncomment the "http://..." line below,
# edit it to point to the current version URL, comment out the 
# "versions.cfg" line and run "bin/buildout" while attached to the 
# Internet. Generally, you only want to do that as part of a planned migration.
# Note that if you are updating components, you should also check the versions
# section at the end of this file, since recipes or components other than
# those of Zope and Plone may need updating at the same time.
#
extends = 
    base.cfg
    versions.cfg
#    http://dist.plone.org/release/4.0.2/versions.cfg


############################################
# Ports
# -----
# Specify the port on which your Zope installation
# will listen:
http-address = 8080


# If you try to start Zope as root, it will change user id to run as
# the effective user specified here. This user id must own the var directory
# of your buildout.
effective-user = cb


############################################
# Eggs
# ----
# Add an indented line to the eggs section for any Python
# eggs or packages you wish to include.
#
eggs =
    Plone
    PIL==1.1.6
    z3c.form
    plone.app.z3cform
    plone.app.registry
    five.grok
    bika.lims


# Alpha note: many of the products below are not yet
# adapted to Plone 4.
#
# Optional Functionality
# ----------------------
# Uncomment the indented lines to include these products.
# Documentation on all of them, along with many more products,
# is available at
# http://plone.org/products/
#
# Commonly used products:
# * LinguaPlone provides tools for building multi-lingual sites
# * PloneFormGen provides through-the-web form building
#
#    Products.LinguaPlone
#    Products.PloneFormGen
#
# Commonly used development tools:
# Several excellent development tools are included in the develop.cfg
# buildout extension. Read it to learn how to activate these tools.

    
############################################
# ZCML Slugs
# ----------
# Some eggs need ZCML slugs to tell Zope to
# use them. This is increasingly rare.
zcml =
    plone.reload

    
############################################
# Development Eggs
# ----------------
# You can use paster to create "development eggs" to
# develop new products/themes. Put these in the src/
# directory.
# You will also need to add the egg names in the
# eggs section above, and may also need to add them
# to the zcml section.
#
# Provide the *paths* to the eggs you are developing here:
develop =
#    src/my.package
    src/bika.lims

############################################
# Debug Mode
# ----------
# Change debug-mode to "on" to run in development mode.
# This will dramatically slow Plone.
# 
debug-mode = off
# Add-on developers should turn deprecation warnings on
deprecation-warnings = off
# change verbose-security to "on" for useful security errors while developing
verbose-security = off


############################################
# Backup Directory
# ----------------
# Sets the target directory for the bin/backup and bin/snapshotbackup
# commands. Default is inside this project's var directory, but ideally
# this should be on a separate volume or backup server.
# 
backups-dir=${buildout:directory}/var


############################################
# Initial User
# ------------
# This is the user id and password that will be used to create the initial 
# user id that will allow you to log in and create a Plone site. This only
# sets the initial password; it will not allow you to change an already 
# existing password. If you change the admin password via the web interface,
# the one below will no longer be valid.
# If you find yourself locked out of your Zope/Python installation, you may
# add an emergency user via "bin/plonectl adduser".
user=admin:admin


############################################
# Parts Specification
#--------------------
# Specifies the components that should be included in the buildout.
# All the basics are in the base.cfg extension; you may add your
# own if you need them at the end of this file.
parts =
    instance
    zopepy
    zopeskel
    unifiedinstaller
    chown


############################################
# Versions Specification
# ----------------------
# Version information supplied here will "pin" Python packages to a particular
# version number, even when you use the "newest" flag running buildout.
# Specifying versions for all packages is a good idea and can prevent
# accidental changes when you add new packages to your buildout.
# Note that versions specified here will override those specified earlier
# in the configuration, including those from the Plone and Zope version
# config files.
