Introduction
============

SENAITE.CORE is an Open Source Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
for enterprise environments, especially focused to behave with high speed,
excellent performance and good stability. 

This software is a derivative work of `Bika LIMS <https://github.com/bikalims/bika.lims>`_
software and comes with the same user interface. Since SENAITE.CORE provides the
core functionalities and entities used by `SENAITE.LIMS <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.lims>`_,
the installation of the latter is strongly recommended for an optimal user
experience.


Installation
============

SENAITE.CORE is built on top of `Plone CMS <https://plone.org>`_, so it must be
installed first.
Please, follow the `installation instructions for Plone 4.x <https://docs.plone.org/4/en/manage/installing/installation.html>`_
first.

Once Plone 4.x is installed successfully, you can choose any of the two options
below:

Ready-to-go installation
------------------------
With this installation modality, the sources from ``senaite.core`` will be
downloaded automatically from `Python Package Index (Pypi) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/senaite.core>`_
want the latest code from the `source code repository <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core>`_,
follow the installation instructions for development.

Create a new buildout file ``senaite.cfg`` which extends your existing
``buildout.cfg`` – this way you can easily keep development stuff separate from
your main buildout.cfg which you can also use on the production server::

  [buildout]
  extends = buildout.cfg

  [instance]
  eggs +=
      senaite.core

  [versions]
  setuptools =
  zc.buildout =
  CairoSVG = 1.0.20
  five.pt = 2.2.4

Note that with this approach you do not need to modify the existing buildout.cfg
file.

Then build it out with this special config file::

  bin/buildout -c senaite.cfg

and buildout will automatically download and install all required dependencies.

For further details about Buildout and how to install add-ons for Plone, please check
`Installing add-on packages using Buildout from Plone documentation <https://docs.plone.org/4/en/manage/installing/installing_addons.html>`_.


Installation for development
----------------------------

This is the recommended approach how to enable ``senaite.core`` for your
development environment. With this approach, you'll be able to download the
latest source code from `senaite.core's repository <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core>`_ 
and contribute as well.

Use git to fetch ``senaite.core`` source code to your buildout environment::

  cd src
  git clone git://github.com/senaite/senaite.core.git senaite.core

Create a new buildout file ``senaite.cfg`` which extends your existing
``buildout.cfg`` – this way you can easily keep development stuff separate
from your main buildout.cfg which you can also use on the production server.

``senaite.cfg``::

  [buildout]
  extends = buildout.cfg
  develop +=
      src/senaite.core

  [instance]
  eggs +=
      senaite.core

  [versions]
  setuptools =
  zc.buildout =
  CairoSVG = 1.0.20
  five.pt = 2.2.4

Note that with this approach you do not need to modify the existing buildout.cfg
file.

Then build it out with this special config file::

  bin/buildout -c senaite.cfg

and buildout will automatically download and install all required dependencies.

For further details about Buildout and how to install add-ons for Plone, please check
`Installing add-on packages using Buildout from Plone documentation <https://docs.plone.org/4/en/manage/installing/installing_addons.html>`_.
